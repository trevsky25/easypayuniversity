# EasyPay University Compliance Reference Guide
## Complete Compliance Framework for Claude Code Development

*This document serves as the authoritative compliance reference for all EasyPay University content development. Claude Code should reference this document when creating, reviewing, or modifying any training materials, user interfaces, or educational content.*

---

## üö® CRITICAL COMPLIANCE ALERT
**This document contains legally required guidelines. All content MUST comply with these standards to avoid regulatory violations, consumer harm, and legal liability.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL STATE RESTRICTIONS
- **19 states offer RIC ONLY** (AK, AZ, CA, DE, ID, KS, KY, MO, NV, NH, NM, ND, OR, PA, SD, UT, VA, WA, WI)
- **3 states offer LTO ONLY** (TX, FL, GA)
- **NO state offers both products - it's always one OR the other**
- **EasyPay does not operate in 28 states + D.C.**

### üìç IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
**Before creating ANY content, you MUST:**
1. Identify the target state
2. Verify EasyPay operates there (only 22 states)
3. Determine if state offers RIC or LTO (never both)
4. Use ONLY the appropriate product content for that state

## State Product Map - CRITICAL REFERENCE

### üó∫Ô∏è EASYPAY OPERATES IN ONLY 22 STATES

| Product Type | States | Count | Training Focus |
|-------------|--------|-------|----------------|
| **RIC ONLY** | AK, AZ, CA, DE, ID, KS, KY, MO, NV, NH, NM, ND, OR, PA, SD, UT, VA, WA, WI | 19 | Credit/Finance/APR terminology |
| **LTO ONLY** | FL, GA, TX | 3 | Lease/Rental/EPO terminology |
| **NO SERVICE** | AL, AR, CO, CT, HI, IL, IN, IA, LA, ME, MD, MA, MI, MN, MS, MT, NE, NJ, NY, NC, OH, OK, RI, SC, TN, VT, WV, WY, DC | 29 | "Not Available" messaging |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ABSOLUTE RULES
1. **NO state has both products** - It's always one OR the other
2. **Product is determined by state** - State dictates everything
3. **Never mix content** - RIC and LTO training must be completely separate
4. **Majority of U.S. not covered** - 29 jurisdictions have no EasyPay services

---

## Executive Summary

EasyPay operates ONE distinct financial product per state:
1. **Retail Installment Contracts (RIC)** - Credit sales agreements in 19 states
2. **Lease-to-Own (LTO)** - Rental-purchase agreements in 3 states

**CRITICAL: No state offers both products. Each state has EITHER RIC or LTO, never both.**

### Geographic Coverage
- **RIC States**: AK, AZ, CA, DE, ID, KS, KY, MO, NV, NH, NM, ND, OR, PA, SD, UT, VA, WA, WI (19 total)
- **LTO States**: TX, FL, GA (3 total)
- **Non-Operating**: 28 states + Washington D.C.

### Key Legal Framework
- **Federal Laws**: Truth in Lending Act (TILA) for RIC only, UDAAP provisions for all products
- **State Laws**: Varying requirements based on product type
- **Regulatory Bodies**: CFPB, state departments of financial protection

---

## Critical Compliance Principles

### 1. One Product Per State - ABSOLUTE RULE
```
Each state offers EITHER RIC or LTO, NEVER both
- 18 states = RIC ONLY
- 3 states = LTO ONLY  
- 29 states + DC = No operations
```

### 2. Product Distinction is Paramount
- **NEVER** use loan/credit terminology for Lease-to-Own (LTO) products
- **NEVER** use lease/rental terminology for Retail Installment Contracts (RIC)
- **NEVER** mention "our other product" since no state has both

### 3. State Verification is Mandatory
- **ALWAYS** check state before displaying ANY content
- **ALWAYS** validate product matches state
- **ALWAYS** show "not available" for non-operating states

### 4. Accuracy Over Marketing
- Legal accuracy ALWAYS takes precedence over marketing appeal
- Never simplify if it changes legal meaning
- Use exact contract language when possible

### 5. No Cross-Product References
- Training for RIC states should NEVER mention LTO
- Training for LTO states should NEVER mention RIC
- Each state's training is completely independent

## Product-Specific Guidelines

### RETAIL INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS (RIC)

#### Approved Terminology
| ‚úÖ USE THIS | Context |
|-------------|---------|
| Retail Installment Contract | Product name |
| Finance charges | Interest costs |
| Amount financed | Principal amount |
| Annual Percentage Rate (APR) | Interest rate |
| 90-Day Finance Charge Cap Promotion | Promotional offer |
| Credit sales agreement | Contract type |
| Truth in Lending disclosures | Required disclosures |

#### Prohibited Terminology
| ‚ùå NEVER USE | Why It's Prohibited |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Same as cash | Implies no additional cost |
| No interest / Interest-free | Finance charges always accrue |
| Deferred interest | Charges accrue from day one |
| 90-Day Same-as-Cash | Misleading promotion description |
| Free financing | Nothing is free |
| Grace period | No period without charges |
| Soft credit check only | Hard inquiries may occur |

#### Critical RIC Compliance Points

##### Finance Charge Cap Promotion (FCCP)
```markdown
REQUIRED DISCLOSURE TEMPLATE:
"Finance charges accrue daily from the date the agreement is signed.
There is NEVER a finance charge 'free' period.
If you pay your amount financed within 90 days, finance charges are capped at $40.
To qualify: You MUST pay more than regular scheduled payments.
Regular payments alone will NOT satisfy FCCP requirements."
```

##### Credit Check Disclosure
```markdown
ACCURATE STATEMENT:
"'No Credit Needed' means no minimum credit score required.
However, EasyPay may perform hard credit inquiries.
Credit history is one factor in approval decisions."
```

### LEASE-TO-OWN (LTO)

#### Approved Terminology
| ‚úÖ USE THIS | Context |
|-------------|---------|
| Lease-to-Own | Product name |
| Rental-Purchase Agreement | Contract type |
| Lease payments | Payment type |
| Early Purchase Option (EPO) | Buyout option |
| Personal Property | Leased items |
| Cash Price | Base cost |
| Cost of Rental | Additional cost over cash price |
| Processing Fee | One-time fee |
| Regular Payments | Scheduled payments |

#### Prohibited Terminology
| ‚ùå NEVER USE | Why It's Prohibited |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Loan / Lending | LTO is not a credit product |
| Interest / Finance charges | These terms don't apply to leases |
| Credit / Financing | Mischaracterizes the product |
| Borrower / Lender | Wrong relationship type |
| Principal | No principal in a lease |
| APR | Doesn't apply to leases |
| Discount | EPO is not a discount |
| Build credit | LTO doesn't report to bureaus |

#### Critical LTO Compliance Points

##### Ownership Structure
```markdown
MUST EXPLAIN:
1. EasyPay Leasing purchases merchandise from merchant
2. EasyPay Leasing owns the Personal Property
3. Customer leases (rents) the Personal Property
4. Ownership transfers only after:
   - All lease payments completed, OR
   - Early Purchase Option exercised
```

##### Tax Handling Process
```markdown
CRITICAL PROCESS:
1. Merchant lists EasyPay Leasing as purchaser
2. Merchant uses EasyPay's tax-exempt ID
3. NO sales tax charged at point of sale
4. EasyPay Leasing collects tax through lease payments
5. Estimated tax shown on page 2 of lease agreement
```

##### Early Purchase Options
```markdown
90-DAY EPO REQUIREMENTS:
- Cash Price
- Plus: $39 Processing Fee  
- Plus: Applicable taxes
- Plus: Any outstanding fees
- Must pay EXTRA beyond regular payments

STANDARD EPO FORMULA:
(Remaining Regular Payments √ó 70%) + fees + taxes
Available after 90-day period
```

---

## Prohibited Practices

### Universal Prohibitions - NEVER Use These

#### Phrases That Violate Compliance
1. **"Same as Cash"** - Implies no additional cost when costs exist
2. **"No Interest"** or **"Interest-Free"** - Finance charges/rental costs always apply
3. **"Deferred Interest/Charges"** - Charges accrue from day one
4. **"Build/Fix/Improve Your Credit"** - Neither product reports to credit bureaus
5. **"Guaranteed Approval"** - All applications subject to underwriting
6. **"No Credit Check"** - Credit checks may be performed
7. **"Everyone Qualifies"** - Not everyone will be approved
8. **"No Hidden Fees"** - Implies others might hide fees
9. **"Better than [Competitor]"** - Comparative claims risk legal action
10. **"Free Period"** - No period without charges/costs

#### Actions That Violate Compliance
- Using store email/phone for customer applications
- Signing on customer's behalf
- Rushing the signing process
- Hiding or minimizing disclosures
- Making verbal promises not in writing
- Stacking multiple financing options
- Collecting sales tax on LTO transactions
- Promoting products for credit building

## Compliant vs Non-Compliant Examples

### Example 1: Finance Charge Cap Promotion (RIC)

#### ‚ùå NON-COMPLIANT VERSION:
```
"Enjoy 90 days with no interest! Our same-as-cash promotion 
means you pay nothing extra for three months!"
```
**Violations**: Claims no interest, uses "same-as-cash", implies no charges

#### ‚úÖ COMPLIANT VERSION:
```
"Finance charges accrue daily from your agreement date. 
With our 90-Day Finance Charge Cap Promotion, if you pay 
your entire amount financed within 90 days, finance charges 
are capped at $40. You must pay more than regular scheduled 
payments to qualify for this promotion."
```

### Example 2: Credit Requirements

#### ‚ùå NON-COMPLIANT VERSION:
```
"Bad credit? No credit? No problem! We don't check credit 
and everyone gets approved instantly!"
```
**Violations**: False no credit check claim, guaranteed approval

#### ‚úÖ COMPLIANT VERSION:
```
"No Credit Needed means no minimum credit score is required. 
We may perform credit checks as part of our approval process. 
Approval is based on multiple factors including income and 
banking history."
```

### Example 3: LTO Ownership

#### ‚ùå NON-COMPLIANT VERSION:
```
"Finance your purchase with no interest through our leasing 
program. You own it while making affordable payments!"
```
**Violations**: Calls lease "financing", claims "no interest", says customer owns during lease

#### ‚úÖ COMPLIANT VERSION:
```
"With Lease-to-Own, EasyPay Leasing purchases and owns the 
merchandise. You lease it from us and can acquire ownership by 
completing all lease payments or exercising an Early Purchase 
Option. This is a lease, not a loan."
```

### Example 4: Early Purchase Options

#### ‚ùå NON-COMPLIANT VERSION:
```
"Get a huge discount with our 90-day same-as-cash option! 
Just make your regular payments for 90 days!"
```
**Violations**: "Same-as-cash", calls it "discount", wrong payment requirement

#### ‚úÖ COMPLIANT VERSION:
```
"The 90-Day Early Purchase Option lets you acquire ownership 
by paying the Cash Price plus $39 processing fee, taxes, and 
any fees within 90 days. You must pay MORE than regular 
payments - either larger payments or additional lump sums."
```

### Example 5: Tax Collection (LTO)

#### ‚ùå NON-COMPLIANT VERSION:
```
"You'll pay sales tax at checkout, which we'll include in 
your monthly lease payment for convenience."
```
**Violations**: Says customer pays tax at checkout

#### ‚úÖ COMPLIANT VERSION:
```
"No sales tax is collected at checkout. EasyPay Leasing 
purchases the item tax-exempt. We calculate and collect 
applicable sales tax as part of your lease payments. 
See page 2 of your lease for estimated tax amounts."
```

  const availability = stateProductAvailability[stateCode];
  
  if (!availability || !availability.active) {
    throw new Error(`EasyPay does not operate in ${stateCode}`);
  }
  
  // CRITICAL: Only ONE product per state
  console.log(`${stateCode} offers ${availability.product} ONLY`);
  
  return availability.product;
}

// Content validation - CORRECTED
function validateContentForState(content, stateCode) {
  const stateProduct = getAvailableProduct(stateCode);
  
  if (stateProduct === 'RIC') {
    // Check for LTO terms in RIC state
    const ltoTerms = ['lease', 'rental', 'LTO', 'Early Purchase Option', 
                      'EPO', 'Personal Property', 'Cost of Rental'];
    for (const term of ltoTerms) {

        throw new Error(`LTO term "${term}" found in RIC-only state ${stateCode}`);
      }
    }
  } else if (stateProduct === 'LTO') {
    // Check for RIC terms in LTO state
    const ricTerms = ['RIC', 'finance charge', 'APR', 'interest', 
                     'FCCP', 'Truth in Lending', 'credit agreement'];
    for (const term of ricTerms) {
      if (content.includes(term)) {
        throw new Error(`RIC term "${term}" found in LTO-only state ${stateCode}`);
      }
    }
  }
  
  return content;
}
```

.tiny-text { font-size: 8px; } /* Too small */
.light-gray { color: #f0f0f0; } /* Not conspicuous */
```

#### Required Proximity
```html
<!-- Disclosures must be NEAR related claims -->
<div class="promotion">
  <h3>90-Day Finance Charge Cap!</h3>
  <!-- Disclosure IMMEDIATELY follows claim -->
  <p class="disclosure">
    Finance charges accrue from day one. Must pay in 
    full within 90 days. See terms for details.
  </p>
</div>
```

#### Form Validation
```javascript

## Development Best Practices

### Component Architecture
```javascript
// Create state-specific components - NEVER mix products
const StateRouter = ({ stateCode }) => {
  // Determine product based on state
  const RIC_STATES = ['AK', 'AZ', 'CA', 'DE', 'ID', 'KS', 'KY', 'MO', 
                      'NV', 'NH', 'NM', 'ND', 'OR', 'PA', 'SD', 
                      'UT', 'VA', 'WA', 'WI'];
  const LTO_STATES = ['FL', 'GA', 'TX'];
  
  if (RIC_STATES.includes(stateCode)) {
    return <RICComponent state={stateCode} />;
  } else if (LTO_STATES.includes(stateCode)) {
    return <LTOComponent state={stateCode} />;
  } else {
    return <NotAvailableComponent state={stateCode} />;
  }
};

const RICComponent = ({ state }) => {
  // RIC-specific logic only
  // Never reference LTO
};

const LTOComponent = ({ state }) => {
  // LTO-specific logic only
  // Never reference RIC
};

const NotAvailableComponent = ({ state }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Service Not Available</h2>
      <p>EasyPay Finance services are not currently available in {state}.</p>
      <p>We currently operate in 22 states. Please check if you're in an eligible location.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

// ‚ùå NEVER create mixed components
const FinancingComponent = () => {
  // WRONG - Don't create universal components
};
```

### Error Messages
```javascript
// Compliant error messages
const errorMessages = {
  creditCheck: "Your application requires additional review.",
  // NOT: "You failed the credit check"
  
  notApproved: "We're unable to approve your application at this time.",
  // NOT: "You've been rejected"
  
  missingInfo: "Please provide all required information.",
  // NOT: "Your credit is too bad"
  
  // State-specific error messages
  productNotAvailable: "This product is not available in your state.",
  // NOT: "RIC not offered in LTO states" (too specific)
  
  stateNotServiced: "EasyPay Finance does not currently operate in your state.",
  // NOT: "Your state is not supported"
  
  wrongProductForState: (state) => {
    const RIC_STATES = ['AZ', 'CA', 'DE', 'ID', 'KS', 'KY', 'MO', 
                        'NV', 'NH', 'NM', 'ND', 'OR', 'PA', 'SD', 
                        'UT', 'VA', 'WA', 'WI'];
    const LTO_STATES = ['FL', 'GA', 'TX'];
    
    if (RIC_STATES.includes(state)) {
      return "Retail Installment Contracts are available in your state.";
    } else if (LTO_STATES.includes(state)) {
      return "Lease-to-Own options are available in your state.";
    } else {
      return "EasyPay Finance services are not available in your state.";
    }
  }
};

// State violation handlers
const stateViolationHandlers = {
  ricInLTOState: (state) => {
    console.error(`COMPLIANCE VIOLATION: Attempted to show RIC in LTO-only state ${state}`);
    // Log to compliance monitoring
    // Redirect to LTO options
    return "Please explore our Lease-to-Own options available in your state.";
  },
  
  ltoInRICState: (state) => {
    console.error(`COMPLIANCE VIOLATION: Attempted to show LTO in RIC-only state ${state}`);
    // Log to compliance monitoring
    // Redirect to RIC options
    return "Please explore our Retail Installment Contract options available in your state.";
  },
  
  invalidState: (state) => {
    console.error(`Service not available in ${state}`);
    // Alert sales team for potential expansion
    return "We're not currently available in your area, but we're growing! Check back soon.";
  }
};
```

### Data Handling
```javascript
// Separate data models - NEVER mix products
const RICApplication = {
  productType: 'RIC',
  availableStates: ['AZ', 'CA', 'DE', 'ID', 'KS', 'KY', 'MO', 
                    'NV', 'NH', 'NM', 'ND', 'OR', 'PA', 'SD', 
                    'UT', 'VA', 'WA', 'WI'],
  amountFinanced: 0,
  apr: 0,
  financeCharge: 0,
  // RIC-specific fields only
};

const LTOApplication = {
  productType: 'LTO',
  availableStates: ['FL', 'GA', 'TX'],
  cashPrice: 0,
  processingFee: 39,
  rentalPayments: [],
  // LTO-specific fields only
};

// State-based product routing
function getApplicationTypeForState(stateCode) {
  if (RICApplication.availableStates.includes(stateCode)) {
    return 'RIC';
  } else if (LTOApplication.availableStates.includes(stateCode)) {
    return 'LTO';
  } else {
    return null; // State not serviced
  }
}
```

## Compliance Contacts & Resources

### Internal Escalation Path
1. First: Check this document
2. Second: Review actual contracts
3. Third: Contact legal/compliance team
4. Fourth: Pause development if uncertain

### Regulatory Resources
- CFPB: www.consumerfinance.gov
- TILA Regulations: Regulation Z
- State Resources:
  - CA: Department of Financial Protection and Innovation
  - TX: Office of Consumer Credit Commissioner
  - FL: Office of Financial Regulation

### Red Flags Requiring Immediate Legal Review
- Any content comparing to competitors
- New promotional offers or changes
- State-specific content
- Collection or servicing procedures
- Any "creative" marketing language
- Simplified explanations of legal terms

---

## CRITICAL FINAL REMINDERS

### STATE-FIRST DEVELOPMENT
1. **Every piece of content is state-specific** - No universal training materials
2. **21 states only** - Most of the U.S. is not covered
3. **One product per state** - Never both, always either RIC or LTO
4. **State determines everything** - Product, terminology, regulations, training

### COMPLIANCE HIERARCHY
1. **This is a legal document** - Violations can result in fines, lawsuits, and criminal charges
2. **State law governs** - Each state has unique requirements
3. **When in doubt, don't guess** - Ask legal team
4. **Accuracy over engagement** - Boring but compliant is better than exciting but illegal
5. **Document everything** - Maintain audit trails
6. **Update regularly** - Regulations change frequently

### The Golden Rules
- **If the state doesn't match the product, don't show it**
- **If you wouldn't want a regulator to see it in a compliance exam, don't create it**
- **If you're mixing RIC and LTO content, STOP immediately**
